# 0.5.3Toolbox

Multihack for World of Warcraft alpha version 0.5.3, made using [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll/) 

This hack makes no attempts to bypass any anticheat and is simply modifying values in memory. Some features may not work on certain servers. I am only making this as a learning project.
